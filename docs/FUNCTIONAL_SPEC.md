## Contribution Guidelines

This section describes the structure of this document, and how to add to, or modify, it.
This document is written in Markdown, and is stored in the web app's GitHub repository to ensure
its version history is tracked with Git.

### Specification Definitions

All functional specifications are listed under the [Specifications](#specifications) heading.
Each specification describes a subset of the web app's features, typically limited to a specific domain.
For example, a specification may describe all features related to "Requests for Information".

Each specification also lists features grouped by each of the web app's user personas.
The user persona groupings are:

- Program Staff
- Public Sector Buyers
- Vendors
- Anonymous Users (users that have not signed in)
- All Users

The following snippet describes the structure of a specification, and can be used as a template when
adding new specifications to this document.

#### Specification Structure

```markdown
### [Specification Name, e.g. "Requests for Information"]

#### Program Staff

[List of Features]

#### Buyers

[List of Features]

#### Vendors

[List of Features]

#### Anonymous Users

[List of Features]

#### All Users

[List of Features]
```

### Feature Definitions

Each feature defined under each user persona should be structured using the following syntax (similar to Cucumber's BDD language, [Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/)):

#### Feature Definition Structure

```markdown
Given [PREMISE]  
[And [ADDITIONAL_PREMISE]]  
When [ACTION]  
[And [ADDITIONAL_ACTION]]  
Then [OUTCOME]  
[And [ADDITIONAL_OUTCOME]].
```

Note that the "And" clauses are optional, and each line in a feature definition ends with two blank spaces, which is how new lines are authored in Markdown.

The following snippets provide examples of how actual feature definitions should be authored.

#### Feature Definition Example 1

```markdown
Given the Program Staff has accepted the terms and conditions  
When the Program Staff clicks a link to a User's profile  
Then the Program Staff is shown the User's profile.
```

#### Feature Definition Example 2

```markdown
Given the Program Staff has accepted the terms and conditions  
And the Program Staff is viewing a Buyer profile  
When the Program Staff changes the Buyer's verification status using a dropdown  
Then the Buyer's verification status is changed to the Program Staff's selection.
```

#### Tips for Writing Feature Definitions

- Each feature definition should explicitly define its premises. For example, note how "Feature Definition Example 2" above does not implicitly rely on the premise that a Program Staff has accepted the terms and conditions from "Feature Definition Example 1" to view a Buyer's profile. In other words, a feature definition should not rely on premises from other definitions — they should be as comprehensive as possible.
- Always capitalise user personas, and refer to them explicitly. For example, "Given the **P**rogram **S**taff...". i.e. Never refer to users with pronouns (e.g. "they"). If you need to refer to a generic user, simply refer to them as "User."
- Each clause in a feature definition should be separated by a new line (two blank spaces at the end of each line in Markdown).
- Multiple features should be separated by a paragraph (a full blank line between feature definitions in Markdown).
- Other than capitalisation, feature definitions (generally) do not require punctuation, except for a full stop at the end of the definition.
